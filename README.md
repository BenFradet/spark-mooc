### spark-mooc

Python notebooks for the spark courses on edx:

  - `lab*` notebooks relate to the [Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark edX course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-big-data-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs100-1x)
  - `ML_lab*` notebooks relate to the [Scalable Machine Learning edX course](https://www.edx.org/course/scalable-machine-learning-uc-berkeleyx-cs190-1x)

For some reason (can't remember why) the labs numbered 2 for each course are
missing, contributions are welcome.
